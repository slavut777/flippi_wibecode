# Espoo Real Estate Dashboard - Test Report (May 2025)

## Summary
I've conducted comprehensive testing of the "Espoo Real Estate Dashboard" application, focusing on the functionality requested in the review. The application has several working features but also some critical issues that need to be addressed.

## Test Results

### 1. Data Import Functionality
✅ **WORKING**: The "Import Sample Data" feature successfully imports data from the sample files.
- Successfully imported 5633 properties (2846 sales, 2787 rentals)
- The success message is displayed correctly
- Property count is updated to 1000 (Note: This seems to be a limit set in the application)

### 2. Map with Property Markers
✅ **WORKING**: The map loads correctly and displays property markers.
- All property markers are displayed on the map
- The map is interactive (zoom, pan)
- Property count shows 1000 properties
- Average sale price shows 364,852 €
- Average ROI shows 22.4 years

### 3. Heat Map Functionality
❌ **NOT WORKING**: The Heat Map feature has a critical JavaScript error.
- Error message: "heatmapMetric is not defined"
- The error occurs when clicking the Heat Map button
- No heat map is rendered on the map
- The error is in the getHeatmapData() function where it tries to use an undefined variable

### 4. ROI Map Functionality
❌ **NOT WORKING**: The ROI Map feature is not accessible.
- The ROI Map button is visible in the UI
- After clicking Heat Map (which errors), the ROI Map button becomes unresponsive
- Building outlines are not displayed

### 5. Filtering Functionality
⚠️ **PARTIALLY WORKING**: The filter UI works but doesn't affect the displayed properties.
- Filter inputs can be filled in (rooms, price, etc.)
- Apply Filters button works without errors
- However, the number of displayed markers remains the same (1000) regardless of filter settings

### 6. Data Display Issues
⚠️ **PARTIALLY WORKING**: Some data statistics appear incorrect.
- Average Rental Price shows "0 € /month" despite having rental data
- This suggests an issue with the rental data processing or display

## API Testing Results
The backend API endpoints are working correctly:
- GET /api/properties: Returns property data successfully
- GET /api/property-types: Returns available property types
- GET /api/property-sources: Returns data sources
- GET /api/properties/stats/regions: Returns region statistics
- POST /api/properties/upload-csv: Successfully imports CSV data

## Technical Issues

### Critical Issues:
1. **Heat Map Error**: The JavaScript variable `heatmapMetric` is referenced but not defined, causing the Heat Map functionality to fail completely.
2. **ROI Map Unavailable**: After the Heat Map error occurs, the ROI Map functionality becomes inaccessible.

### Secondary Issues:
1. **Filtering Not Working**: The filters don't seem to affect the displayed properties.
2. **Rental Price Display**: Average Rental Price shows as 0 despite having rental data.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Heat Map Functionality**:
   - Define the missing `heatmapMetric` variable in the getHeatmapData() function
   - Add error handling to prevent the entire component from crashing

2. **Fix ROI Map Functionality**:
   - Ensure the ROI Map button remains functional even if Heat Map fails
   - Implement proper error boundaries in React components

3. **Fix Filtering**:
   - Ensure filters are properly applied to the displayed properties
   - Add visual feedback when filters are applied

4. **Fix Data Display**:
   - Investigate why rental prices are showing as 0
   - Ensure all statistics are calculated correctly

## Conclusion
The Espoo Real Estate Dashboard has a solid foundation with working backend APIs and basic map functionality. However, the Heat Map and ROI Map features are currently non-functional due to JavaScript errors. These issues should be addressed to provide a complete and functional user experience.
