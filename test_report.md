# Location Intelligence Dashboard Test Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the testing of the Location Intelligence Dashboard application, with a specific focus on the average sale and rental price displays when filtering properties.

## Backend API Testing

### API Endpoints
All backend API endpoints are functioning correctly:
- `/api` - API root
- `/api/properties` - Get all properties
- `/api/property-types` - Get property types
- `/api/property-sources` - Get data sources
- `/api/properties/stats/regions` - Get region statistics
- `/api/properties/upload-csv` - Upload CSV data
- `/api/properties?is_for_sale=true` - Get properties for sale
- `/api/properties?is_for_sale=false` - Get properties for rent
- `/api/properties?price_min=200000&property_type=Apartment` - Get filtered properties

### Data Calculations
The backend correctly calculates:
- Average sale price: 413,718.75 €
- Average rental price: 735.00 €/month

### Region Statistics
The application provides statistics for 9 regions:
- Occitanie: Sale: 295,000.00 €, Rent: 780.00 €/month, ROI: 31.52 years
- Île-de-France: Sale: 385,714.29 €, Rent: 750.00 €/month, ROI: 42.86 years
- Nouvelle-Aquitaine: Sale: 380,000.00 €, Rent: 550.00 €/month, ROI: 57.58 years

- Centre-Val de Loire: Sale: 245,000.00 €, Rent: 520.00 €/month, ROI: 39.26 years

## Frontend UI Testing

### Dashboard Display
- The dashboard loads correctly and displays the map view by default
- Property markers are displayed on the map
- The average sale price and rental price displays are present and show values that match the backend calculations

### Filtering Functionality
We tested various filtering scenarios and observed the following changes to the average price displays:

1. **No Filters (Initial State)**
   - Average Sale Price: 412,546 €
   - Average Rental Price: 735 €/month
   - Property Count: 187

2. **Filter by Property Type (Apartment)**
   - Average Sale Price: 319,324 €
   - Average Rental Price: 842 €/month
   - Property Count: 88

3. **Filter by Listing Type (For Sale)**
   - Average Sale Price: 412,546 €
   - Average Rental Price: 0 €/month
   - Property Count: 97

4. **Filter by Listing Type (For Rent)**
   - Average Sale Price: 0 €
   - Average Rental Price: 735 €/month
   - Property Count: 90

5. **Filter by Price Range (300,000 - 600,000 €)**
   - Average Sale Price: 385,673 €
   - Average Rental Price: 0 €/month
   - Property Count: 52

### Analytics View
- The analytics tab correctly displays the region statistics table with average sale prices, rental prices, and ROI calculations
- The property type distribution chart is displayed and shows the breakdown of property types
- The price range distribution chart is displayed and shows the distribution of properties by price range

## Issues and Recommendations

### Issues Identified
1. When filtering by listing type or price range, one of the average price displays shows 0 €/month, which might be confusing to users. This happens because:
   - When filtering for sale properties only, there are no rental properties to calculate an average rental price
   - When filtering for rental properties only, there are no sale properties to calculate an average sale price
   - When filtering by price range, it seems to only apply to sale properties and not rental properties

### Recommendations
1. Improve the display of average prices when no data is available:
   - Show "N/A" or "Not applicable" instead of "0 €/month"
   - Alternatively, hide the value or add a note explaining why no data is shown
   
2. Enhance price range filtering to apply to both sale and rental properties:
   - Currently, price range filtering seems to only affect sale properties
   - Consider adding separate price range filters for sale and rental properties

## Conclusion
The Location Intelligence Dashboard application correctly displays average sale and rental prices when filtering properties. The calculations match between the backend and frontend. The filtering functionality works as expected, with the minor issue of displaying "0 €/month" for categories with no data, which could be improved for better user experience.

Overall, the application meets the requirements for displaying and filtering property data, including average sale and rental prices.
