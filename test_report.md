# Espoo Real Estate Dashboard - Test Report (May 2025)

## Overview
This report summarizes the testing of the Espoo Real Estate Dashboard application, with a specific focus on the data import, heat map functionality, average price displays, ROI map, and map styling.

## Backend API Testing

### API Endpoints
✅ All backend API endpoints are functioning correctly:
- `/api` - API root
- `/api/properties` - Get all properties
- `/api/property-types` - Get property types
- `/api/property-sources` - Get data sources
- `/api/properties/stats/regions` - Get region statistics
- `/api/properties/upload-csv` - Upload CSV data
- `/api/properties?is_for_sale=true` - Get properties for sale
- `/api/properties?is_for_sale=false` - Get properties for rent
- `/api/properties?price_min=200000&property_type=Apartment` - Get filtered properties

### Data Import
✅ The backend has successfully imported the CSV data:
- Total properties: 5,654
- Properties for sale: 2,867 (expected ~2,846)
- Properties for rent: 2,787 (matches expected count)

### Region Statistics
✅ The API correctly returns region statistics for Espoo:
- Average sale price: 366,842.78 €
- Average rental price: 963.98 €/month
- ROI: 31.71 years

## Frontend UI Testing

### Dashboard Display
✅ **Frontend Rendering**: The frontend application now loads correctly after fixing the HeatmapLayer import.

✅ **Heat Map Functionality**: The heat map is now working correctly. When selecting the "Heat Map" view, the map displays colored hotspots showing property density.

❌ **ROI Map Functionality**: The ROI Map view doesn't display building outlines with ROI data as expected.

✅ **Map Style (HOT OSM)**: The HOT OSM map style is correctly applied. The map tiles are loaded from "openstreetmap.fr/hot/".

### Data Display Issues
⚠️ **Property Count**: Initially shows 0, then updates to 1000 properties (not the full 5,654 properties).

⚠️ **Average Prices**: 
- Average Sale Price: Shows 364,852 € (close to the expected 366,842.78 €)
- Average Rental Price: Shows 0 € /month (should be around 963.98 €/month)

### Console Errors
⚠️ There's an error in the console: "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 502 ()" which suggests there might be an issue with one of the API calls.

## Issues and Recommendations

### Fixed Issues
✅ **HeatmapLayer Import**: Fixed the import statement for the HeatmapLayer component to use the v3 version:
```javascript
// Changed from:
import HeatmapLayer from 'react-leaflet-heatmap-layer';

// To:
import { HeatmapLayer } from 'react-leaflet-heatmap-layer-v3';
```

### Remaining Issues
1. **ROI Map Building Outlines**: The ROI Map view doesn't display building outlines with ROI data.

2. **Property Count Limitation**: The UI only shows 1000 properties instead of all 5,654 properties.

3. **Average Rental Price**: The average rental price is showing as 0 € /month instead of the expected ~964 €/month.

4. **API Error (502)**: There's a 502 error when making some API calls, which might be affecting data loading.

## Conclusion
After fixing the HeatmapLayer import issue, the application now loads correctly and the heat map functionality is working. The HOT OSM map style is also correctly applied. However, there are still issues with the ROI Map functionality, property count display, and average rental price calculation. These issues should be addressed to fully meet the requirements.

The backend is functioning correctly with the expected data imported (5,654 properties total, with 2,867 for sale and 2,787 for rent).
