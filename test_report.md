# Espoo Real Estate Dashboard - Test Report (May 2025)

## Overview
This report summarizes the testing of the Espoo Real Estate Dashboard application, with a specific focus on the data import, heat map functionality, average price displays, ROI map, and map styling.

## Backend API Testing

### API Endpoints
✅ All backend API endpoints are functioning correctly:
- `/api` - API root
- `/api/properties` - Get all properties
- `/api/property-types` - Get property types
- `/api/property-sources` - Get data sources
- `/api/properties/stats/regions` - Get region statistics
- `/api/properties/upload-csv` - Upload CSV data
- `/api/properties?is_for_sale=true` - Get properties for sale
- `/api/properties?is_for_sale=false` - Get properties for rent
- `/api/properties?price_min=200000&property_type=Apartment` - Get filtered properties

### Data Import
✅ The backend has successfully imported the CSV data:
- Total properties: 5,654
- Properties for sale: 2,867 (expected ~2,846)
- Properties for rent: 2,787 (matches expected count)

### Region Statistics
✅ The API correctly returns region statistics for Espoo:
- Average sale price: 366,842.78 €
- Average rental price: 963.98 €/month
- ROI: 31.71 years

## Frontend UI Testing

### Dashboard Display
❌ **Frontend Rendering**: The frontend application fails to load due to a JavaScript error.

❌ **Heat Map Functionality**: Unable to test due to frontend error.

❌ **ROI Map Functionality**: Unable to test due to frontend error.

❌ **Map Style (HOT OSM)**: Unable to test due to frontend error.

## Issues and Recommendations

### Critical Issue Identified
The frontend application is failing to load due to a compatibility issue between the libraries:

1. **Error Message**: "Super expression must either be null or a function, not undefined"

2. **Root Cause**: The application is using React 19.0.0 and react-leaflet 5.0.0, but it's using an older version of react-leaflet-heatmap-layer (2.0.0) which is not compatible with these newer versions.

3. **Affected Component**: HeatmapLayer from 'react-leaflet-heatmap-layer'

### Recommended Fix
Update the import statement in App.js to use the v3 version of the heatmap layer which is already installed in the project:

```javascript
// Change this:
import HeatmapLayer from 'react-leaflet-heatmap-layer';

// To this:
import HeatmapLayer from 'react-leaflet-heatmap-layer-v3';
```

## Conclusion
The backend is functioning correctly with the expected data imported (5,654 properties total, with 2,867 for sale and 2,787 for rent). However, the frontend application is not loading due to a library compatibility issue. Once the import statement is updated to use the v3 version of the heatmap layer, the application should work correctly, allowing us to test the heat map, ROI map, and HOT OSM map styling functionality.
