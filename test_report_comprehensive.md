## Issues and Recommendations

### Issues:
1. CSV upload functionality fails with a 500 error. The error message indicates that no valid properties were found in the CSV file.
2. When filtering for properties with a minimum price of 200,000 €, the average rental price shows as 0 €/month, which may indicate that no rental properties match the filter criteria.

### Recommendations:
1. Fix the CSV upload functionality by providing better error handling and validation for the CSV file format.
2. Add more detailed error messages for CSV upload to help users understand the required format.
3. Consider adding a sample CSV template for users to download.
4. Improve the filter UI to show when no properties match certain criteria.

## Conclusion

The Espoo Real Estate Dashboard application is functioning well overall. The core features of importing sample data, displaying property markers on the map, visualizing ROI data, filtering properties, and showing analytics are all working as expected. The only issue found was with the CSV upload functionality, which should be addressed in a future update.

The application successfully demonstrates location intelligence for real estate in Espoo, providing valuable insights for property investors through its ROI analysis and visualization tools.
